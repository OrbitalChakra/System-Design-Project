# System-Design-Project
In this project for SNHU, I took the business requirements gathered through a mock interview with the owner of a fictional company DriverPass. The system is designed to be a cloud deployment with offline read and update capabilities in mind. I took into consideration the ease of access for a user and tried to develop a design that would be easy to follow. With new revisions I plan to focus on the expansion of the documents, but would revise the design and logic of registering a user. Although there is a flaw in the business logic required I do believe that developing beyond the scope of the project would be a poor use of resources. I intend to design a project that will work and cover a broad base of use cases within the design.
